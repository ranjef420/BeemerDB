## Source of Truth & Retrieval Order

1) BMW manuals/diagrams are authoritative.
2) Forum-derived signals are supplemental and only considered after a manual/diagram citation is produced.
3) Retrieval precedence: Manual pages → Parts diagrams → Specs/Torque tables → Forum excerpts (with URLs) → Other.
4) SQLite mirror is portable; feature parity with DuckDB is not required (FTS-only mirror is acceptable).
5) Semantic search (VSS) remains in DuckDB. Add sqlite-vss later only if mirror-side VSS becomes necessary.
